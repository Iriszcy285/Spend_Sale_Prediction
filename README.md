# Spend_Sale_Prediction
# Project Overview 
- In this Project, I act as an AI engineer hired by a client to investigate the relationship between advertising (3 features) and sales of product.
- I am provided the datasets of sales of  product in 200 different market and advertising budgets for the product in three different media:TV,Radio,and Newspaper.
-  I used OLS model to create linear regression model and also use different type of method : Gradient descent to recheck again.
# Objective
- My goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of 3 mediao budgets.
# Future works
- In this project, I only compare the relationship between Sales and TV due to time limitation.Actually, I should compare sales with all three features. For future, I would combine analyze the relationship between Sales and other two features, like TV v.s. Sales.
 # Key knowledge
 - Dataset: I used the dataset that provided by client to create scatterplots which is clearer to observe.
 -  Statistical Analysis: Histogram by using Mean, Median,Mode.
 - Descriptive Statistics: calculate lower bound and upper bound by using IQR in my scatterplot to find outliers and Denoise.
 - Inferential Statistics : Using correlation to analzye whether it is linear or non_linear relationship.
 - Linear Regression Model: use OLS model to find best fit that might involve variation and deviation based on mathematical indicator solution.
 - Error Analysis: Uses RSE and R2 statistics to evaluate model performance.
 - Confidence Interval: Use SE to measure each coefficient by using RSE and find range without a fixed value.
- Hypothesis Test: Null Hypothesis/Alteernativa Hypothesis and using T-Statistic whether reject Null Hypothesis or not.
